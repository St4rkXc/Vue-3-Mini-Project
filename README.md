- **Intuitive UI**: Leveraging Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for a clean and functional design.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To explore these projects, follow the setup instructions below:

### Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, I recommend using:

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**
- **[Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)** (ensure Vetur is disabled)

### Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**

   When ready to deploy, compile and minify your project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Lint Your Code**

   To maintain code quality, use ESLint:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## ðŸŽ¨ Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that enhances the development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
- **DaisyUI**: A component library for Tailwind CSS that provides pre-designed UI components.
